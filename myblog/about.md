I am a postdoctoral researcher at GFZ Potsdam working on the numerical modeling of continental rifting. I use the massively parallel, finite element code ASPECT to model 3D time-dependent rifting to explore the formation and rotation of microplates. My focus lies on the East African Rift System, where the Victoria microplate rotates counterclockwise with respect to the Nubian plate. Why it rotates counterclockwise even though surrounding microplates and the Somalian plate rotate clockwise? Come find me at the <a hyperref="https://meetings.copernicus.org/2019AdaLovelaceWorkshop/" target="target">Ada Lovelace 2019 workshop!</a>
