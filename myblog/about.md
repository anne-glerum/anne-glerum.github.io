I am a postdoctoral researcher at GFZ Potsdam working on the numerical modeling of continental rifting. I use the massively parallel, finite element code ASPECT to model 3D time-dependent continental rifting. My focus lies on differentiating between the different geodynamic drivers of the East African Rift System. I am also a maintainer of the ASPECT software and an editor for the EGU Geodynamics blog. Please get in touch on any of these topics!
