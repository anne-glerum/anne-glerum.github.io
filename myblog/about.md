I am a postdoctoral researcher at GFZ Potsdam working on the numerical modeling of continental rifting and its control on the formation of sediment-hosted metal deposits. My main tool is the massively parallel, finite element code ASPECT, which I am currently coupling to a hydrothermal fluid flow code. I am also a maintainer of the ASPECT software. Please get in touch on any of these topics!
