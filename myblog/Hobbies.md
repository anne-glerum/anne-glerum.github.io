Reading
-------

I love reading. And when I can't *read* a book, I'll listen to one. Here my favorite books of 2023: 
  * _The one hundred years of Lenni and Margot_ by Marianne Cronin.
  * _The summer before the war_ by Helen Simonson.
  * _A week in winter_ by Maeve Bincy.
  * _The girl from Berlin_ by Ronald H. Balson.
  * _My murder_ by Katie Williams.
  * _Snow crash_ by Neal Stephenson.
  * _Wool_ by Hugh Howey.
  * _The invisible life of Addie LaRue_ by V. E. Schwab.
  * _Between to moons_ by Aisha Abdel Gawad.
  * _The three-body problem_ by Liu Cixin.
  * _Leviathan wakes_ by James S. A. Corey.
  * _Silent Earth: Averting the insect apocolypse_ by Dave Goulson.


Gardening
---------

Balconies are also gardens! On our Berlin balcony I grow the loveliest strawberries, cucumbers, potatoes and herbs.
I'm particularly interested in permaculture, food forests and organic agriculture.


Furniture restoration
---------
Restoring antique and vintage wooden furniture clears my head. Not having a workshop though, I have to resort to our bathroom, which now houses a collection of tools, varnishes and glues :p.


Dog
----

My dog Rube is always ready to join in on the fun. You probably heard him in one of our Zoom calls.
