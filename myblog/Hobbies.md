Reading
-------

I love reading. And when I can't *read* a book, I'll listen to one. Here my favorite books of 2022: 
  * _This changes everything: capitalism vs. the climate_ by Naomi Klein, 
  * _Parable of the Sower_ by Octavia E. Butler,
  * _Finding Mrs. Ford_ by Deborah Goodrich Royce,
  * _The last palace: Europe's turbulent century in five lives and one legendary house_ by Norman Eisen,
  * _State of terror_ by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Louise Penny and
  * _Americanah_ by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. 


Gardening
---------

Balconies are also gardens! On our Berlin balcony I grow the loveliest strawberries, cucumbers, watermelons, potatoes and herbs.
I'm particularly interested in permaculture, food forests and organic agriculture.

Pets

My dog Rube is always ready to join in on the fun. You probably heard him in one of our Zoom calls.
