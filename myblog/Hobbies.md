Gardening
---------

Balconies are also gardens! On our Berlin balcony I grow the loveliest strawberries, cucumbers, potatoes and herbs.
I'm particularly interested in permaculture, food forests and organic agriculture.


Furniture restoration
---------
Restoring antique and vintage wooden furniture clears my head. Not having a workshop though, I have to resort to our bathroom, which now houses a collection of tools, varnishes and glues :p.


Dog
----

My dog Rube is always ready to join in on the fun. You probably heard him in one of our Zoom calls.
